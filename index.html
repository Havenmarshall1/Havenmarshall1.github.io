    <h3>Coffee Drinks</h3>
    <p>As the caption explains, I drink coffee like it's water, yes, I know that is not healthy. But it is like it's an ddiction. I think I ahve drank it so much I do not get the caffeine effects anymore haha, my body is prone to it. </p>

          <h4>Dutch Bros</h4>
          <h5></h5>
          <p>I would call myself pretty lucky to live in a town that has one of THE BEST coffee shops. I prefer a Dutch Bros drink over Starbucks on a trip because we all know there are Starbucks everywhere, and it is always least likely to find a Dutch. Secret tip: Next time you are at Dutch order a Capri Sun Rebel Blended, you will thank me later.</p>

          <h4>Starbucks</h4>
          <h5></h5>
          <p>How could I forget the most popular of all time...Starbucks. Anyone's all time favorite, am I right? Especially a Caramel Frap with extra caramel, Cafe Vanilla Frap, or a Chai Tea Latte. Mmmm... The most delicious drinks to cure any craving: coffee, sweet, and caffeine. </p>
